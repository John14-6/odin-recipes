        </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 cup milk</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
                    <li>mix and let sit for ~15 minutes</li>
                </ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons and 2 teaspoons milk</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a separate bowl, beat together buttermilk, milk, eggs and melted butter. Keep the two mixtures separate until you are ready to cook.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. You can flick water across the surface and if it beads up and sizzles, it's ready!</li>
            <li>Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture, using a wooden spoon or fork to blend. Stir until it's just blended together. Do not over stir! Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/2 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
